solution 1

create k Queues, 
for each integer, Enqueue it to the corresponding Queue;
call Dequeue in the order

(this yields O(n) complexity, but require that k is not too large)


solution 2

partition the integers in k sub sequences starting with an arbitrary pivot;
it will call the partition function logk times
each time n comparisons
