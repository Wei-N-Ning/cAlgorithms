scan array A and find the first Element that violate the order - it is the end of the sorted portion;

for the remaining Elements, let K = n^1/2
the time complexity for this step is (n^1/2)log(n^1/2)

let f(n) = (n^1/2)/2log(n); g(n) = n
prove that g(n) dominate f(n)

n <-> (n^1/2)/2log(n)
(n^1/2) <-> 1/2log(n)
(n^1/2) <-> log(n)

a linear term n dominates this term
