solution 1

create three Queues for those colors
for each Element:
    Examine() the color of the Element;
    CCI_Enqueue() the element to the Queue representing its color
call CCI_Dequeue() from red-white-blue queues

(this will preserve the relative order within each color group)


solution 2

find a white Element;
use this Element as pivot, 
place all the red and white Elements to its left
place all the blue Elements to its right

(this does not necessarily preserve the relative order - e.g. the white group)
