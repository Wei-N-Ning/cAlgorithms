once S is sorted;

if S_max < x/2, there is no solution;
if S_min > x/2, there is no solution either;

for each E in S if E <= x/2
    let E' = Sum - E
    test that E' is also in S

because x/2 divide S to S1 and S2

O = S1 * lgS2 < n * lgS2 < n * lgn

O = (N - S2) * lgS2
  = N * lgS2 - S2 * lgS2
    Dominate
