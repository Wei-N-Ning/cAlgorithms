create an array S that holds elements taken from the head and tail
of each row, e.g.

{r1_head, r1_tail, r2_head, r2_tail ... rn_head, rn_tail}

this array is by definition sorted in ascending order

binary search to determine x's position in this array:

1) x is a head or tail -> bingo
2) x > r(i)_tail and x < r(i+1)_head -> x is not in M
3) x < r(i)_tail and x > r(i)_head
    binary search x in row i

num of comparison in worse case:
exhaust S to find one row then exhaust that row only to find
x is not there:
len(S) + len(row)

= 2 * len(column) + len(row)
= 2m + n
