solution 1

for each row
    if head == 0 -> found
    if tail == 0 -> found
    if head > 0 and tail > 0 -> skip
    if head < 0 and tail < 0 -> skip
    if head < 0 and tail > 0 -> do binary search for 0

n*log(n)

solution 2

for each row
    if head == 0 -> found
    if tail == 0 -> found
    if head > 0 and tail > 0 -> skip
    if head < 0 and tail < 0 -> skip
    if head < 0 and tail > 0 -> mark row index in R

for each column
    if head == 0 -> found
    if tail == 0 -> found
    if head > 0 and tail > 0 -> skip
    if head < 0 and tail < 0 -> skip
    if head > 0 and tail < 0 -> mark column index in C

in the sub matrix R x C
for each R:
    binary search for 0

O(n)
