sort 2n players by their rating (quicksort, in-place) - nlogn

struct Player {
    int id;
    int rating;
}

int compare(struct Player *p);

take the first n players for team A;
take the second n players for team B;


to change it to a fair game:

keep the first part unchanged;
take the first n/2 and the last n/2 players for team A;
take the rest for team B;
