1)
set a pivot, say the last Element, EL
move all the Elements that are smaller than EL to the left;
move all the Elements that are larger than EL to the right;
EL either equals to the Element or not

2)
set a pivot, last Element, EL
move all the Elements that are smaller than EL to the left;
move all the Elements that are larger than EL to the right;
for the left part, repeat the same operation;
for the right part, repeat the same operation;
if either part has more than n/2 elements, the Element at the center is the target
