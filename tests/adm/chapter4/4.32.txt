a)
n is known
use binary search - log(n)

b)
n is not known
start from 2, each time increase the number to 2**n, therefore
the sequence of questions look like:
>2? >4? >8? >16? ....
once the number is known to sit between 2**(n-1) and 2**(n),
use binary search to find it
this will still yield log(n) upper bound
