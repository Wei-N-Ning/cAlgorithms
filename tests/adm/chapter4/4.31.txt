1) A[k - 1]

2) treating A as a binary tree, search for at maximum log(n) times
 the height of the binary tree;
to visit each non-leaf Element, each time, compare the parent with
left & right children, verifying that:
parent >= left >= right
left child index = parent index * 2 + 1
right child index = left child index + 1
if any index > size - 1, bail out
